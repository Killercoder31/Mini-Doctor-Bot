Bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchi (large and medium-sized airways) in the lungs that causes coughing.
Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diseases. About 5% of adults are affected and about 6% of children have at least one episode a year.
Chronic bronchitis is defined as a productive cough – one that produces sputum – that lasts for three months or more per year for at least two years.
Many people with chronic bronchitis have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Tobacco smoking is the most common cause, with a number of other
factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role.
Chronic bronchitis can lead to a higher number of exacerbations and a faster decline in lung function.
Acute bronchitis usually has a cough that lasts around three weeks, and is also known as a chest cold. In more than 90% of cases the cause is a viral
infection. These viruses may be spread through the air when people cough or by direct contact. A small number of cases are caused by a bacterial infection
such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Bordetella pertussis. Risk factors include exposure to tobacco smoke, dust, and other air pollution.
