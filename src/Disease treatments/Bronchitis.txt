Treatment of acute bronchitis typically involves rest, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to help with
the fever.

Treatment of chronic bronchitis include quitting smoking, vaccinations, rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids.
Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy.
